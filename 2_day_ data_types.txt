Data types
=========
java is strong typed programming language .[type chacking is very important]

Q: why java is strongly typed programming language? [ because type checking is strong ]
1:In java every varaiable and every expression has some type .
2:each and every data type is clearly define
3:every assigenment should be checked by checked by compiler for type compatibility
4:because of above reason we can conclude java language is strong typed programming language.

Q:java is pure object oriented language or not? [ it is not pure]
1: when compare with old language c and c++ java has more object oriented in nature.
ans --> 2: java is not a pure object oriented programming language because of primitive data types.[opertore overloading , multiple inheritance etc]

Q:Define a data type?
--> data type define the variable which type of data

Q:types of data types
--> they are two types of data types
	1:primitive data type
	2:non-primitive data type?
	
Q:define a primitive data type?
--> primitive data type is built in data type
--> the size of primitive data type is fixed

Q:define non-primitive data type?
--> non-primitive is user defined data types
--> the size of non-primitive data type is not a fixed


Q:how many primitive data types? [8]
--> primitive data types divided into 2 types 
	1:numeric data types
	2:non-numeric data types
	
Q:define a numeric data type?
--> the data type hav number on it.
	
Q:how many types of numeric data type?[2]
--> numeric data type divided into two types
	1:Integeral data type
	2:Floating point data type
	
Q: define a Integer data type?	
--> the data type does not have decimal point on it .
	
Q:how many type of Integer data type?
--> they are 4 type of integer data type
	1:byte
	2:short
	3:int
	4:long
	
Q: define floating point data type?
--> the data type does have decimal  point on it . 
	
Q:how many types of floating data type?
--> they are 2 types of floating data type
	1:float
	2:double
	
Q: define a non-numeric data type?
-->

Q:types of non-numeric data type?
--> they are two types
	1:char
	2:boolean
	
common thing for data type
--------------------------
1:except char and boolean remaining data type is called  " signed data type ".[int x = +112 , double d = -2.345] beacuse we can represent both +ve and -ve numbers

note
----
--> sing bit 
	0 ---> +ve
	1 ---> -ve

Q:explain byte date type?
--> size of byte data type is 1 byte.
--> 1 byte is equal to 8 bits
--> byte is signed data type 
--> maximum value is +127
--> minimu value is -128
--> range is -128 to +

--> the most significant bit [msb] act as sing bit.
--> 0 means +ve number
--> 1 means -ve number
--> +ve number will be represented directly in a memory
--> -ve number will be represented in 2`s complimantory form.

Q:byte b = 128; it is valid or not?
--> it is not a valid it will through compile time error 
	CE : possible loss of precisions 
		 found : int
		 required : byte
		 
Q:byte b = 1.28; it is valid or not?
--> it is not a valid it will through compile time error 
	CE : possible loss of precisions 
		 found : double
		 required : byte
		 
Q:byte b = true; it is valid or not?
--> it is not a valid it will through compile time error 
	CE : incompatible type 
		 found : boolean
		 required : byte
		 
Q:byte b = "Tanveer"; it is valid or not?
--> it is not a valid it will through compile time error 
	CE : incompatible type 
		 found : java.lang.string
		 required : byte
		 
Q: where byte data type is a best choice?
--> If u want to handle a data in term of "streams" either from the "file" or from the "network" then go for byte.
--> file supported form and network supported form is a byte.
--> they are two types of streams
	1: character streams
	2: byte streams
	
Q:explain short data type data type?
--> short is most rarely date type used in java.
--> size of short is 2 byte. [ 16 bits]
--> maximum value 32767
--> minumu value is - 32768
--> range -2^15 to 2^15 - 1

Q:short s = 32768; is valid or not?
--> it is not a valid it will through compile time error
	CE : possible loss of precisions 
		 found : int
		 required : short
		 

Q:short s = 32.768; is valid or not?
--> it is not a valid it will through compile time error
	CE : possible loss of precisions 
		 found : double
		 required : short
		 

Q:short s = true; is valid or not?
--> it is not a valid it will through compile time error
	CE : incompatible type
		 found : boolean
		 required : short
		 

Q:short s = "patel"; is valid or not?
--> it is not a valid it will through compile time error
	CE : incompatible type 
		 found : java.lang.string
		 required : short
		 
Q: when short data type is best choice?
--> it is best choice when we used "16 bit micro processor like [8085]" but these micro processor is completed out dated.
--> and hence corresponding short date type is out dated data type.


Q:explain int data type?
--> most "commonely used data in java" is int data type.
--> size 4 bytes [32 bits]
--> maximum value -2147483648
--> minimum value 2147483647
--> range -2^31 to 2^31 -1

Q:every integer number treated as which date type bydefult?
--> every integer number treated int data type by defult.

Q: int x = 2147483648; it is valid or not?
--> it is not valid it will through compile time error
	CE : integer number is too large

Q: int x = 2147483648L; it is valid or not?
--> it is not valid it will through compile time error
	CE : possible loss of precisions
	found : long
	required : int

Q: int x = true; it is valid or not?
--> it is not valid it will through compile time error
	CE : incompatible type
	found : boolean
	required : int
	
	
Q: int x = 2147.483648; it is valid or not?
--> it is not valid it will through compile time error
	CE : possible loss of precisions
	found : double
	required : int
	
Q: explain long data type?
--> some time int may not enough to hold big value then we should go for long values
exmp:
	1: the amout of distnce travel by leight in 1000 days,to hole this value int may not enough we should go for lonng data type.
	
    long l = 1,26,000*60*60*24*1000 miles;
	
	2: the number of character present in big file " may excied int range" hence the return of length is long but not int.
	
	long l  = f.length();
	
--> size of long is 8 bytes.[64 bits]
--> range 2^63 to 2^63 - 1 

conclusion
--> if we want to represent small value then go for " byte".
--> if we want to represent more then byte then go for " short".
--> if we want to represent more then short then go for " int".
--> if we want to represent large value then go for " long".


note : all the above date types( byte , short , int , long ) used for represent integral value if u want to remaining
	   floating point data type then we should go for floating point data type.
	   
	   
Q:explain floating point data type?
float
------
1: float : if u want 5 to 6 decimal places of accuracy then u will go for float.
2: float follow " single precision".
3: size of float 4 bytes.[ 32 bits]
4: range -3.4e38 to 3.4e38
 
 double
 ----
1: double : if u want 14 to 15 decimal points of accuracy then you will go for double.
2: double follow " double precision" [ precision = accuracy]
3: size of double is 8 bytes [ 64 bits]
4: -3.7e308 to 3.7e308


Q:explain boolean data type?
--> size of boolean is not applicable [ virtual machine dependent]
--> range is not applicable [ but allowed values are true or false ]

Q: boolean b = true; is valid or not?
--> it is a valid

Q: boolean b = 0; is valid or not?
--> it is an invalid and it will through compile time error
	CE: incompatible type
	found : int
	required : boolean
	
Q:boolean b = True; is valid or not;
--> it is invalid and it will through compile time error [ if the value is not an any type then it will treat as varaiable ]
	CE : can not find symbol
	symbol : varaiable True
	location: class Test
	
Q:boolean b = "True"; is valid or not;
--> it is invalid and it will through compile time error
	CE : incompatible type
	found : java.lang.string
	required : boolean
	
exmp:
	int x = 0 
	if(x)
	{
	sout("hello");
	}
	else
	{
	sout("hi");
	}
	
	o/P: CE : incompatible type
		 found : int
		 required : boolean
		 
		 
	while(1)
	{
	sout("hii");
	}
	o/P: CE : incompatible type
		 found : int
		 required : boolean
		 
	note: if , while , do while take boolean value only .[ true and false]
	
Q: explain char data type?
--> the size of char data type is 2 byte.[16 bits]


Q: why size of char 2 bytes in old language [c / c++ ] size of char is 1 byte ?
--> java is unicode based and old language are ASCII code based.
--> old languages [ c and c++] are ASCII code based and number of allowed different ASCII code character are allowed to less then <= 256.
--> to represent 256 character 8 bits are enough
--> hence the size of char in old languages is 1 bytes

--> but java is unicode based and the number of allowed different unicode character are > 256 and <= 65536
--> to represent these many character 8 bit many not enough we should required 16 bits
--> The size of char java is 2 bytes
--> range 0 to 65535 character


Wrapper class and default values
==============
byte --- Byte --- 0
short --- Short --- 0
int  --- Integer --- 0
long --- Long --- 0
float --- Float --- 0.0
double --- Double --- 0.0
boolean --- Boolean --- false
char --- Character --- 0 [ 0 represent space character ]

Q: what is default value for object?
--> null is default value for object type.
--> null can not be apply for primitive
--> if we are trying to used for primitive it will give compile time error.

Q:char c = null; it is valid or not?
--> it is invalid and through compile type error
	CE: incompatible type
	found : null type
	required : char
