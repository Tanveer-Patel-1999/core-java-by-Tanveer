Abstract : not complete just partially complete
========
Q : what is Abstract keyword?
--> The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier.
--> The abstract keyword used for classes and methods.
--> The abstract is not used for variable.


abstract methods :
==================

Q : what is abstract methods?
--> the methods declared with abstract keyword is called abstract methods.
--> abstract methods have " only declaration " but not have " implemention ". 
--> if we dont no the implemention that time we go for the abstract methods.
--> abstract methods does not have body.
--> abstract methods end with semicoulumn.

exmp : 
		public abstract int numberOfWheels();


example :
		public class Vehical
		{
			public int numberOfWheels()
				{
					return ....;
				}
		}
		
example :
		public class Fruits
		{
			public int getTest();
				
		}
--> if we dont no the implemention how many wheels for the vehical.[ 2velar , 4velar , auto , truck etc]

Q : who is responsible for abstract methods implemention?
--> child classes are responsible for provide implemention for abstract methods.

Q : programing example of abstract methods in real time?
example :
		Loan example with getIntrestRate for loans [ gold , home , education etc]
		
		public class Loan
		{
			public int getIntrestRate();
				
		}
		
Q : which one is valid abstract method?
1 : public abstract void m1() { }
2 : public void m1() { }
3 : public void m1();
4 : public abstract void m1();

--> 4 : public abstract void m1();


abstract class : partially implemention of class are called as abstract class.
==============

Q : what is mean by abstract class?
--> If the implemention of a class is not complete or partially implemention such type of classes we are declared as abstract.
--> If the class is abstract then "no one can create an object of that class ".

abstract class vs abstract method
=================================
 abstract class
 -------------
 example : 
 
 abstract class Test
 {
	public abstract void show();
 }
 
 1 : if a class contain atleast one abstract method then the class should be abstract.
 2 : we can create an object of an abstract class.
 3 :
