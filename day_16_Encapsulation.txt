OOPS CONCEPT : 
==============

3 : Encapsulation : process of grouping variable and method into a singleUnit
=================

Q : what is mean by Encapsulation?
defination 1 : --> The process of grouping the " data members and coressponding method into a single unit " is called Encapsulation.
Example :
		Every java class is an Example of Encapsulation.
		
		class Student
		{
			private int id;
			private String name ;
			
			public void name ()
			{
			..
			}
		}
	
defination 2 : --> Encapsulation = data-hiding + abstraction

defination 3 : --> hiding the data behind the method the concept is called as encapsulation. [ setter() and getter()] 

Q : how to achieve Encapsulation?
--> decalared data members. as a private
--> used getter and setter method for every data members.
		
Q : which component is Encapsulated component?
--> The component which follow " data-hiding and abstraction" that component is said be encapsulate component.


Q : example of encapsulation?
--> example

	class Account
	{
		private double balance;
		
		public double getBalance()
			{
				// validation 
				return balance;
			}
			
		public void setBalance(double amount)
			{
				//validation
				this.balance = 	this.balance + amount;
			}
				
				
	}
	
Q : what is purpose of getter and setter method?
--> using this we can provide the " validation ".
--> outside person always call getter and setter method required data or required operation.

--> main purpose of getter and setter method using this we can access from outside .
--> after validation in the getter and setter method we can get the required data and perform required operation. 

Q : Encapsulation = data-hiding + abstraction where is data-hiding and abstraction.
--> data-hiding : we decalared balance variable as a private.
--> abstraction : we provide GUI screen whenewere end user click " balance-enquery button"  or "deposite button ".
	1 : balance-enquery button enter getBalance() methode is executed 
	2 : decalared button enter setBalance() method is executed
	
note : end user only seen GUL screen not showen our actual implemenation : abstraction

Q : how to outside person can able to access the data?
--> using getter() and setter() method outside person can access the data.

Q : what is the advantages of Encapsulation?
--> security is a biggest advantage.
--> Enhancement become very easy without effecting the end user.
--> maintainability of application is improve.

Q : what is the dis-advantages of Encapsulation?
--> increase a line of code becuse every variable we should provide getter() and setter() method.
--> performnace is down 
--> time consuming
