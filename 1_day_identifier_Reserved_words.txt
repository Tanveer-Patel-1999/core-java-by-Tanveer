1: All 53 reserved words in java contains only lower case alphabates symbol.
2: In java we have only "new" keyword in java and there is no "delete" keyword in java because destruction of usless object is responsibilty of " grabage of collector" .
3: the following are new keyword in java [ strictfp (1.2v), assert (1.4v) , anum (1.5v) ]
4:  strictfp but not strictFp and 
	instanceof but not instanceOf
	synchronized but not synchronize
	extends but not extend
	implements but not implement
	import but not imports
	const but not constant
