Interface
=========

Q: what is an interafce?
1 : Defination--> Interface is a "service requirement specification" [SRS] is called as interafce
2 : Defination--> any contract between " client and service provider" is called as Interface.  [ service provider : provides an implementation]
3 : Defination--> Interface is a " 100% pure abstract class". [ from 1.8 static , default and private  methode are came]

--> every method present in an Interface by default " public and abstract".


Q : how to declared an Interface?
--> we can define a Interface using " interafce keyword".
--> example :
	interafce interafce_name
	{
		void m1();
		
		void m2();
	}
	
	class ServiceProvide implements interafce_name
	{
		public void m1()
		{
		..
		}
	}
note :
1 : whenewere we override the interface method into the class that time we should declared a method as " public" compulsory.
2 : whenewere we implements interafce we should "override all the method present in the interafce" or we can declared as class as "abstract".	
	
Q : who is responsible for implementation of interafce?
--> class is responsible for implementation of an interface
